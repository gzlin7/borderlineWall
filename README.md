**Updating Rooms:**
To add a room,
1) save the image as png and the text as html following the examples in the rooms folder. Don't forget to include the social media links in the html if applicable. Follow the naming convention of room**X** for both files where **X** is the index of the entry in the Tunnel66 Submission Form responses spreadsheet (in Borderline Drive). 

2) change index.html to set maxRoom to **X** (the number of the latest entry).
  
3) git pull in Borderline AFS locker


**Description:**
Tunnels connect many of MIT's buildings, and they can even connect a community in quarantine. Inspired by Corona Maison, Tunnel66 is a place to gather and showcase the unique cultures of current and prospective MIT students, in lieu of CPW. Each student adds a room to Tunnel66, forming one connected tunnel below. Click on a room to learn more about the artist!

**About Us:**
Made with love by MIT Borderline, the student group responsible for augmented reality murals in the tunnels under Building 66. The idea is that since the actual MIT Borderline tunnels are off limits now, Tunnel66 strives to bring the magic of the tunnels-- a living, breathing collaborative work of art where students can express themselves and share with the community-- to prefrosh and current students alike.

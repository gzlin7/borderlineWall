<p>Hi! My name is Amber Zheng, and I am a class of ‘22 course 6-14 (Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science) living in McCormick. On campus, I’m involved in a couple of dance groups, class council, and greek life. 
</p>
<p>My drawn room contains some of my favorite things: Hamilton quotes, comfy lounge chairs, and my plush Mr. Orange! The floor is a garden of dandelions, because when I was younger, I really enjoyed picking a dandelion, making a wish, and blowing the seeds off of the flower. I love the idea that this simple act can grant a wish, but more than that, I love the hope that the flowers represent.

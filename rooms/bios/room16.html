<p>I'm Jessica, an adMITted prefrosh, and I'm really looking forward to coming to MIT in the fall! I'm currently thinking about majoring in 6-7, and joining lots of cool looking clubs, including Borderline :)

<p>I'm used to traditional watercolors, but I'm trying out digital art during the quarantine. This isn't what my room looks like, but I've always wanted to paint a room like this. Hope everyone is staying safe and doing well!

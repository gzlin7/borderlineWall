<p>I'm a prefrosh '24 called Jie! I do a lot of digital art (main reason being I have no traditional materials lol) and like making games so I'm probably going to head into a course 6 study, but let's see where 4 years takes me. The room is based off my room if it was actually good looking ahdhfsd. I’ve got a lot of hobbies that I do for fun, and basically if I’m interested in something I’ll just go for it.  Excited to see you all in the flesh!</p>

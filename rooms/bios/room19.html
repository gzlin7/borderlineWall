<p>Hi! I'm Jocelin, a current freshman studying 6-3 and 18. My "room" is a raft composed of the various things keeping me sane right now, such as Zoom calls with friends, card games (Fish), listening to music, and my comfy bed, floating isolated in a great body of water. I enjoy sketch and painting, and am a beginner to digital art but would love to practice more. In addition to having painted a mural for Borderline, I'm involved in the Society of Women Engineers, Asian Dance Team, and Next Sing. Really can't wait to return to campus and see everyone again! </p>

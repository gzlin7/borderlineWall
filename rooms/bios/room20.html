<p>Hey, I’m Dezell, and I’m a ‘22 majoring in AeroAstro. I’m a huge comic book fan, so I decided to draw Miles Morales (or myself, can’t really decide) hanging from the ceiling and reading the Mind and Handbook. When I’m not cranking out Unified psets, I’m singing in the MIT Gospel Choir or engaging in *general shenanigannery* in Maseeh. As is the case with my actual dorm room, Miles’s walls are covered in posters. The Iron Man helmet on the floor is a nod to one of my favorite MIT memories, meeting Ironheart creator Brian Michael Bendis after he gave a lecture on campus. (There’s also a little “Remove Before Flight” tag attached to the helmet. It’s a Course 16 thing.)</p>

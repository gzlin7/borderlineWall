<p>Hi I'm Jessica! I'm a '22 studying course 2 (Mechanical Engineering) with an Energy Studies and Environment & Sustainability Minor. I'm involved in running Trash2Treasure, which is a campus-wide reuse program, and Next Big Thing, in which we typically build *big fun stuff* in the courtyard of Next House when there's no pandemic :'/ I like to spend my free time painting, hiking, kickboxing, and making spotify playlists for obscure scenarios. I'm not super familiar with digital drawing so this was a fun challenge (luckily I had a photo reference). It's a sunset over a section of the Green Line in Boston. Something I love about MIT is the sense of adventure and creative expression students have so I wanted to show my appreciation for that with the two little characters on the left. I wish everyone the best in these crazy times &lt;3</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Greg. I'm a 2022, and most of my time at MIT is spent either making video games or at the gym. My room is crazy (because I'm unironically insane), it's full of art that I've drawn for my games/for fun (besides the pokemon, which were drawn by the pokemon people). Most of it relates to stuff that I'm into, namely Fairy Tail, Boku no Hero, and Pokemon. So yeah, if you wanna talk about video game stuff with me or anything really, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

<p>Hi, I am Irina. I spend most of my time at MIT connecting people but I also like to paint. My [dream] room has huge windows, lots of open space and spectacular views of Boston. I would love a view of the mountains on a misty lake too but that’s for a different painting.  I dug out some simple MATLAB code for the walls and the floor.  Can’t wait to be back on campus.</p>
